# Calculo del Fair Value

### Stock Valuation

I like the notion of comparing a stock's dividend yield to its own historical average dividend yield. It provides a simple way to do stock valuation.

Let's take another look at JNJ. With a five-year average dividend yield of 2.73%, what is a reasonable fair value estimate of JNJ? Assuming that no dramatic events will impact JNJ's business, then the average dividend yield can be used to calculate a reasonable fair value price. Just rearrange the dividend yield formula:

> _Dividend yield_ = 100 × annual dividend / current stock price

As follows:

> _Fair value price_ = 100 × annual dividend / average dividend yield

JNJ's forward dividend is $3.60, so a reasonable fair value of JNJ is:

> _Fair value price_ = 100 × 3.60 / 2.72 = $131.87or about **$132**

For comparison, Morningstar's fair value is $130 and finbox.io's fair value is $126.11.

With JNJ trading at about $132 per share, the stock appears to be fairly valued.

To determine price targets where JNJ would be undervalued or overvalued, consider the stock's five-year dividend yield range, from the high dividend yield of 3.31% to the low dividend yield of 2.27%. That represents a range of about 1.0%.

If we use approximately 10% on either end of this range to signify extreme dividend yields, then _undervalued_ would be at 3.31% - 0.1% = 3.21%, while _overvalued_ would be at 2.27% + 0.1% = 2.37%.

> _Undervalued target_ = 100 × 3.60 / 3.21 = $112.15or about **$112**
>
> _Overvalued target_ = 100 × 3.60 / 2.37 = $151.90 or about **$152**

Should JNJ's stock price decline by about 15% to $112 or below, the stock would be undervalued. And should the stock price increase by about 15% to $152 or above, the stock would be overvalued.

Calculating undervalued and overvalued targets using the average dividend yield of a stock can help investors establish good entry and exit points.

Buying dividend growth stocks when undervalued not only locks in a high yield, but also offers the best opportunity to benefit from stock price increases. And selling dividend growth stocks when overvalued locks in profits and offers more opportunities to deploy the proceeds in undervalued stocks with higher yields.
